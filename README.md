# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show how other kickstarter campaigns did based on their launch dates and funding goals for Lousise can see how her play, Fever, did against other projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One difficulty I encountered was to make a pivot table with a list of months for outcomes based on launch date. I made an ifs statement in a new column to get months, but realized putting the Dates Created Conversion field would display in months when I put it in the rows. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? //
Based on the data, it seems like the most amount of successful kickstarters start in summer, where the amount skyrockets on May and that they start dipping after October and continue to fall until January. December has a similar amount of failed kickstarters as successful


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? //
The percentage of successful kickstarters seems to become less than failed once the goal becomes higher than 15000, but becomes higher again in the range of 35000 and 44999 before most of them fail completely. this tells me plays start becoming more unlikely as the goal increases 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? //
The outcomes based on goals have an interesting section where there are more successful than failed kickstarters between 35000 and 44999 and it is difficult to tell why there is a sudden climb. maybe they fall within a certain timeframe, or are in specific countries, etc, that the current charts can't show.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? //
other tables/graphs that my be useful could be to show successful and failed outcomes from certain countries, have a graph that shows whether being a staff pick affects the amount pledged, and a graph that compares how much is pledged vs goals.
